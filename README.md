In many developing countries the malpractice of reusing medical waste, particularly syringes, is observed and administered worldwide each one bringing with it a risk of transmitting disease.

The existing solutions for ceasing reuse of syringes are too expensive and yield indistinguishable syringes, and hence provides only one-way authentication, that is by healthcare workers. We need a two-way mechanism that bootstraps even the most uneducated patient.

Our proposal, The Color-Changing Syringes, adds only up to 0.007$ to the syringe and is the most cost-effective/profitable solution today. We are using manufacturing techniques to make better syringes using a colour-dye system that turns blue if the syringe had been used. This is 10 times cheaper than the existing solutions proposed by the WHO. Using a photochromic dye that changes colour when exposed to light irreversibly, distinguishes a used from an unused syringe. The patient will know when a used syringe is being injected on him/her.
