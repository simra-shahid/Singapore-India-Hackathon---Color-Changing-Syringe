# Singapore-India-Hackathon--Color-Changing-Syringe

My team's pitch in Singapore India Hackathon. We were felicited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Education Minister of Singapore Ong Ye Kyun. 

In many developing countries the malpractice of reusing medical waste, particularly syringes, is observed and administered worldwide each one bringing with it a risk of transmitting disease.

The existing solutions for ceasing reuse of syringes are too expensive and yield indistinguishable syringes, and hence provides only one-way authentication, that is by healthcare workers. We need a two-way mechanism that bootstraps even the most uneducated patient.

Our proposal, The Color-Changing Syringes, adds only up to 0.007$ to the syringe and is the most cost-effective/profitable solution today. We are using manufacturing techniques to make better syringes using a colour-dye system that turns blue if the syringe had been used. This is 10 times cheaper than the existing solutions proposed by the WHO. Using a photochromic dye that changes colour when exposed to light irreversibly, distinguishes a used from an unused syringe. The patient will know when a used syringe is being injected on him/her.
